# The Story

We are Acme, Inc., a company that helps chain retailers forecast
sales. This repo is our framework for generating predictive models
based on each of our clients' historical data. 

We assume that Acme has a roughly-standard data format, and asks
clients to supply data in that format. Here, we simulate that
process by pulling data from Kaggle and transforming it into 
the format that a client's application may natively use -- a 
hierarchical structure similar to typical normalized relational
data or object structure.
